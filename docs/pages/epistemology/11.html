# Davidson’s reply to the sceptic #9

Davidson holds that scepticism arises when we think in terms of setting our entire system of beliefs over and against the reality to which they must correspond if they are true.

Anything that we can offer by way of assurance that our beliefs are true is, of necessity, something that belongs within the system of beliefs. But nothings from truth as correspondence between the system and something outside it seems to require.

Davidson argues that any appeal to experience as something that is outside our system of beliefs and therefore as something against which the system could be tested is doomed. First of all, it makes no sense to speak of our system of beliefs being justified by sensory experience. The relation of justification is a logical relation that holds between one belief and another, but cannot hold between a belief and something conceived as what connect us to the world, as what provide us with information about it, then the question arise as to whether we should trust them.

Davidson’s general conclusion is that any attempt to ground our system of belief on experience is philosophically doomed. If we are to find our having knowledge of the world intelligible, we must try another tack. He believes that we need to dismantle the idea of a confrontation between our system of beliefs and something outside them.

We must accept that the only thing that can justify a belief is another belief, but we must also find a way to show that this does not leave us with the mere idea of a coherent system of beliefs that could, for all we know, be false. The question he believes we need to consider is: why can’t all my beliefs hang together in a coherent system and yet be comprehensively false about the world.

The important thesis that he sets out to establish in his paper is this: that belief is , in its nature, veridical. His aim is to show that scepticism cannot get off the ground because it is incoherent to suppose that we have beliefs and that the majority of these beliefs might be false.

The essential assumption behind the picture that, according to Davidson, makes scepticism inevitable is the idea that we can first of all fix the content of a subject’s Davidson wants to show is false. He wants to argue that in attributing beliefs with a determinate content to a subject we are already committed to regarding those beliefs as largely true. This is what Davidson means when he says that belief is in its nature veridical.

Davidson gets rid of the idea of meanings as internal representation by focusing on the idea of a systematic theory of meaning for a language. Such a theory would have to provide, for every sentence, s, of the language a statement of what s means. Because the number of sentences in any natural language is indefinitely large, we would have to think of such a systematic theory as breaking the language don into sub-sentential expression (words), each of which makes a systematic contribution to the meaning of a sentence in which it occurs. The systematic theory will then derive the meaning of each sentence from the meaning of the sub-sentential expressions that occur in it and how they are put together.

Davidson then agued that the model for a systematic theory of meaning of this kind is provided by a Tarski-style theory of truth for a language. Alfred Tarski was concerned with the problem of defining truth. He argued that a general definition of truth is impossible, but that we can capture something important and distinctive about the concept by defining the predicate ‘is true’ for a particular language. Such a definition words by stating, for each sentence, s, of the language the conditions under which s is true.

Thus, the theory generates for every sentence f the language an instance of the following schema:
S is true if and only is p,
Where s is replaced the name of a sentence of L and p is replaced either by that sentence itself or a translation of it (i.e. where p is replaced by a sentence that gives the meaning of the sentence named by s). For example, in order to define the predicate ‘is true’ for English, the theory must provide a statement of the following kind for every sentence of English:
‘snow is white’ is true if and only if snow is white.

Given that the theory could achieve this only by deriving such statements by means of a semantic structure that sees sentences as composed from a finite stock of expressions each of which makes a systematic contribution to the truth-conditions of sentences in which it occurs, a Tarski-style theory of truth meets the central demand that Davidson places on a systematic theory of meaning for a language. So Davidson claimed outright that a systematic theory of meaning for language (i.e. a theory which provides, for every sentence, s, of a language a statement of what s means) is provided by a Tarski-style theory of truth for that language.

Davidson did not claim that ‘means that’ means the same as ‘is true if and only if’; these are clearly two different concepts. Moreover adopting a Tarski-style theory of truth as a model of what a systematic theory of meaning for a language world look like does not allow Davidson to dispense with the concept of meaning altogether. For although the concept of meaning is not employed within a Tarski-style theory of truth, it is used in Tarski’s expression of the general constraint - known as convention T - on the construction of such a theory. Convention T requires that in every instance of the schema, s is true if and only if p, the sentence that replaces p must have the same meaning as the sentence named by s.

This is where Davidson’s argument gets interesting. He argues that now we have a clear idea of the form that a systematic theory of meaning for a language should take, we can ask ourselves how we might construct such a theory in circumstances in which we do not already understand the language for which the theory is constructed. This is the idea of radical interpretation. We have to cone up with constraints on the construction of a Tarski-style truth theory for a language, which, without presupposing a knowledge of meaning, are sufficiently strong to produce a theory which may be taken to specify the meaning of every expression of the language. Such constraints must show how we are derive a knowledge of meaning form a knowledge of facts that are available independently of a knowledge of meaning.

What sort of evidence might this be? Davidson suggests that it could be evidence of speakers’ general attitudes towards sentences of their language together with the circumstances in which they held them. He imagines such evidence might take the following form:
(E) A belongs to the French speaking community and A held-true the sentence ‘il pleut’ on Saturday at noon and it was raining near A on Saturday at noon.
He imagines that we could accumulate a mass of evidence of this kind. The aim is to provide constraints on theory construction that take us from this mass of evidence to a Tarski-style theory of truth - or what Davidson now calls a theory of interpretation - for the language.

Our task is made more difficult than it might be by the fact that speakers make mistakes, i.e. they hold sentences true in circumstances in which they are not true. Allowing for the equivocal nature of our evidence, Davidson puts forward the following constraint on theory construction:
The principle of Charity: our theory of interpretation must make the speakers of French largely consistent and right, as far as we can tell, as often as possible.

Davison does not believe the constrain is a charitable assumption about human intelligence. Rather he holds that:
If we cannot find a way to interpret the utterances and other behaviour of a creature as revealing a set of beliefs largely consistent and true by our own standards, we have no reason to count that creature as rational, as having beliefs, or as saying anything.

Coming to understand the language of a foreign community is a matter of putting ourselves in a position to understand a mass of individual actions as acts of assertion, command, etc performed by agents that we recognize as rational. If we cannot see them as rational, then we cannot see them as having a language or expressing beliefs at all.
