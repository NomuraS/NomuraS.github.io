# Contextualist responses to Scepticism(Keith DeRose) #5

### Contextualism: the Detail

In ‘Solving the Sceptical Problem’, DeRose tries to work the contextualist strategy out in detail, by identifying the particular conversational norms that the sceptic exploits in order to raise the standards for knowledge in a philosophical context. He puts forward the following principle as capturing our intuitions:

- S does not know that p if S’s belief that p is a belief that S would have even if p were false.

This is an externalist and reliabilist principle. It does not analyse knowledge in terms of the concepts of true, justified belief, but in terms of the idea of a true belief that reliably tracks the truth. A true belief that does not reliably track the truth - i.e. a belief that one would still hold even if the proposition believed were false - does not constitute knowledge. DeRose now introduces a piece of terminology:

- S’s belief is insensitive if S would believe p even if p were false.

We can now state the general, externalist, reliabilist principle as fallows:

- S doesn’t know that p if S’s belief that p is insensitive.

This principle captures the intuition that we can’t achieve knowledge by luck or accident. We need to be in an epistemic position that tracks the truth of p in order to know p. we can capture this idea of tracking truth by using the notion of possible worlds:

- It is not enough that one’s belief as to whether p is true matches the fact of the matter as to whether p is true at the actual world, it must also match it at possible worlds that are close to the actual world.

##### Case1
I am standing in front of one of the very few real barns in a country in which many fake barn-facades have been for fooling foreign visitors. I have a true belief ‘that’s a barn’. There is a very close possible world (one in which I’m standing in front of one of the fake barn-facades) at which ‘that’s a barn’ is false, but still believe it. My belief is insensitive. I don’t know ‘that’s a barn’ in the actual world.

##### Case2
I believe that I have hands. This belief is true in the actual world. In nearby possible worlds in which I have hands, I also believe I have hands. There are also some quite close possible worlds in which I don’t have hands - e.g. a possible world in which I had a nasty accident with a chainsaw. In these possible worlds I don’t believe I have hands. My belief that I have hands tracks truth across these possible worlds, including the closest possible world in which it is false that I have hands. My belief is sensitive. I know I have hands in the actual world.

DeRose now gives the following rule as the rule that determines the conversational standards for knowledge:

- The Rule of sensitivity: when it is asserted that S knows p, the standard for knowledge is raised to such a level as to require S’s belief to be sensitive.

We can use the notion of possible worlds to make this clear. What is determined contextually is the range of possible worlds, centring round the actual world, within which the subject’s belief as to whether p is true must match the fact of the matter in order for the subject to count as knowing. Call this the sphere of epistemically relevant worlds. As standards for knowledge go up the sphere of epistemically relevant worlds becomes larger; the truth- tracking powers of one’s belief must extend further from actuality in order to count as knowledge.

- The Restated Rule of Sensitivity: When it is asserted that S knows p, enlarge the sphere of epistemically relevant worlds, so that it at least includes the closest world in which p is false.

##### Case A
Husband affirms ‘I know the bank is open’ (Kp). At the actual world, p is true. The closest possible world in which p is false is the possible world where there is no Saturday opening. He doesn’t believe the bank is open in that world. His belief is sensitive. He Kp.

##### Case B
Husband affirms Kp. Wife raises question ‘How do you know the bank hasn’t changed its hours?’ (K-q). the sphere of epistemically relevant possible world now expands to include the closest possible world in which -q is false. This possible world is one in which the bank has changed its hours. The husband would still believe -q in that world. His belief is insensitive. Therefore, -K-q. if -K-q, he -Kp. Therefore -Kp.

##### Sceptic
I affirm ‘I know I have hands’ (Kp). At the actual world, p is true. In the closest possible worlds in which p is false, I believe -p. my belief is sensitive. I Kp. The sceptic now raises the possibility that I’m a BIV (K-q?). the sphere of epistemically relevant worlds now expands to include the closest possible world in which -q is false. This world is a world in which I am a BIV. In this possible world I still believe -q. my belief is insensitive. Therefore, I -K-q. if I -K-q, then I -Kp. Therefore, I -Kp.


### Contextualism: Basic Strategy

The sceptic holds that an argument of the following form undermines any claim to know p, where p is a statement about the material world, in any context in which a claim to know p is made:

- If I don’t know I’m not a BIV, then I don’t know p
- I don’t know I’m not a BIV
- I don’t know p

Contextualist holds that this is based on the false assumption that there is an invariant standard of knowledge, on which in order to know anything about the world I have first of all to know that I’m not a BIV.

Contextualist claims that the standards required in order for knowledge to be correctly attributed to an epistemic agent vary with context.

Consider cases A and B. DeRose claims that all of the following propositions seem to be true in respect of A and B:

- (1) The husband’s claim Kp is true in A
- (2) The husband’s claim -Kp is true in B
- (3) If Kp is true in A, then Kp is true in B

The aim of the contextualist account is to show that (1)-(3) are not inconsistent. The Contextualist denies that (1) and (2) are consistent with:

- (4) if what I say in A in claiming to Kp is true, then what I say in B by conceding -Kp is false.

The contextualist holds that (4), unlike (3), is false. For what I say in A when I claim Kp is not what I deny in B, when I concede -Kp. These two propositions are not contradictories, as the meaning of ‘know’ changes between A and B. the move that male (3) consistent with (1) and (2) is the move that takes (3) as uttered in a particular context; (3) is true, for the Contextualist in any which it is uttered. Said in A, with the standards of knowledge that operate there, I know p, relative to those standards, in both A and B. said in B, with the standards of knowledge operating there, I do no know p, relative to these standards, in either A or B.

What makes standards go up and down?
- (1) the importance of my claim’s being correct
- (2) the counter-possibilities to my claim that have been publicly raised
- (3) the counter-possibilities I imply I’ve considered in affirming that I know p

The contextualist holds that these factors affect how good an epistemic position a putative knower must be in order for an attribution of knowledge to be correctly made. The influence of these factors in B have the effect of raising the standards that must be met in order for a knowledge attribution to be correct. Thus, the husband is quite correct when he says -Kp in B, even though he was quite correct when he said, on the basis of quite different standards, Kp in A.

The contextualist claims that the concept of knowledge is indexical. What is meant by the word ‘know’ shifts from use to use, depending on various contextual factors. The general rule governing the word ‘know’ is as follows:

- S knows that p iff S has a true belief that p and is in a good enough epistemic position with respect to p.

How good ‘good enough’ is determined by contextual factors, according to a conversational norm that is still to be specified. How good ‘good enough’ is changes with context. Thus what the husband means by ‘know’ at the beginning of case B is different from what he means by ‘know’ after his wife has pointed out how important it is that he is right and raised the possibility that the band has changed its hours in the last two weeks.

The main aim of contextualism is to resolve the problem posed by the sceptical argument.

According to the Contextualist, when the sceptic presents his argument, he thereby activates conversational norms that have the effect of raising the standards for knowledge. Having altered the conditions under which a knowledge attribution is correct, it is then the case that we are not in a good enough epistemic position to affirm any claim about the material world.

However this has no tendency to show that we don’t satisfy the less austere standards that are in place in ordinary conversations. We can be in a good enough epistemic position, in an ordinary context, correctly to affirm, or attribute, a whole host of claims about the material world.

Thus, the contextualist makes the following three propositions consistent:
- (1) I know I have hands in an ordinary context
- (2) I don’t know I have hands in a philosophical context
- (3) If ‘I know I have hands’ is true in an ordinary context, then it is true in a philosophical context

The important point to remember is that (3) is asserted in a context and is true in that context. In an ordinary context, when ordinary standards for knowledge operate, I know I have hands, relative to those standards, in both an ordinary and a philosophical context. In a philosophical context when higher standards for knowledge operate, I do not know that I have hands, relative to those standards, in either an ordinary or a philosophical context.
