# Scepticism and “Hinge” Propositions #4

### Quotes from Wittgenstein’s On Certainty
(1) When Moore says he know such and such, he is really enumerating a lot of empirical propositions which we affirm without special testing; propositions, that is, which have a peculiar logical role in the system of our empirical propositions. (p136)

(2) All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis tales place already within a system. And this system is not a more or less arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments: no it belongs to the essence of what we call an argument. The system is not so much the point of departure, as the element in which arguments have their life. (p105)

(3) That is to say, the questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on which these turn.
That is to say, it belongs to the logic of our scientific investigations that certain things are in deed not doubted.
But it isn’t that the situation is like this: we just can’t investigate everything, and for that reason we are forced to rest content with assumption. If I want the door to turn, the hinges must stay put. (p341-43)

### Wright’s diagnosis of Moore
Moore wants to use his knowledge that a particular material object exists to justify a claim to know that there is a material world. Thus:

- II this is hand
- III the material world exists

The proof, as we’ve observed, strikes us as unsatisfactory. Wright diagnosis the unsatisfactoriness as follows. There is actually a suppressed premise:

- I I am having hand-type experiences

I provides defeasible evidence for II. What is illegitimate in Moore’s reasoning is that he now tries to justify III on the basis of his justified belief in II, when in fact the justification that I provides for II depends on the presupposition of III. This is plainly circular reasoning. As Wright puts it, a warrant does not transmit from a belief in a proposition, p, to a proposition, q, that is known to be entailed by p, if the truth of q is presupposed in the very existence of the warrant for the belief in p.

If we now observe that no independent warrant can be provided for III, then we seem forced to accept the sceptic’s conclusion that we are never in a position warrantably to move from I to II.

If, however, III is a “hinge” proposition, then no question of an epistemic entitlement to III arises. If we have a non-epistemic entitlement to III, then we can move, via III, from I to II. But how do we fill out the notion of “non-epistemic entitlement”? what is the “peculiar logical role” of hinge propositions that renders them immune to doubt?

### Wright on the Status of Hinge propositions
In a recent paper (“Scepticism, Certainty, Moore and Wittgenstein”), Wright identifies three kinds of propositions that have the status of hinge propositions:

(i)	propositions which are insulated from enquiry (the propositions of arithmetic, the propositions of logic, “I have two hands”, “I have two parents, etc.

(ii)	propositions which are supported by an overwhelming body of evidence, whose significance would have to be dismissed if they were doubted (“it’s 2006, My name is XYZ, etc)


(iii)	type III propositions - “there is a material world”, the world has existed for a long time past”, “Material objects do not disappear when they are unobserved” to -to doubt which would undermine a whole class of propositions by calling into question the bearing of our most basic kinds of evidence for propositions of this kind.

Wright holds that what unifies these various kinds of propositions is that our acceptance of them constitutes our implicit acceptance of rules of evidence. Together they constitute a system of rules for assessing the bearing of specific pieces of evidence on the confirmation and disconfirmation of propositions.

These propositions do not express hinges we know or believe, but rules we go by in carrying out our enquiries.

In “Facts and Certainty”, Wright is tempted by the thought that recognizing that these propositions have the status of rules insulates them from cognitive evaluation: rules define a practice; rules are not correct or incorrect.

In “Scepticism, Certainty, Moore and Wittgenstein”, Wright thinks this is too swift. If a practice has an aim that is external to the practice, then rules can be assessed as successful or unsuccessful in achieving the aim. Our practice of enquiry aims at knowledge of truths. We can, he argues, ask whether the rules of our practice achieve the aim.

Does that mean we’re back with scepticism? Wright argues this is not the case .if we accept that all enquiry, in its nature, requires presuppositions, then any coherent or usable concept of a warrant must accommodate this. Every cognitive project involves an element of risk. Epistemic responsibility cannot require - per impossible - the investigation of every presupposition whose falsity would defeat the claim to have acquired a warrant. If we value enquiry, then we are entitled to adopt presuppositions without evidence that then play a regulative role in the conduct of enquiry. This, he suggests, is not to defeat scepticism, but to make “a liveable accommodation with it.”
