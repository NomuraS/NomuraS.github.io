# Epistemic Externalists responses to Scepticism (Ernest Sosa) #6

The externalist claims that the sceptical argument depends on acceptance of the following principle:

- internalism: A subject, S, knows a proposition, p, iff S is in a position to provide a justification for his belief that p which appeals only to other beliefs that S knows to be true.

Once internalism is accepted, scepticism is inevitable. In order to justify a belief about the material world, I will first of all have to justify the belief that sense experience is veridical, or that I am not a BIV. I cannot justify the latter belief on the basis of experience without assuming what I am attempting to establish. Therefore, I cannot justify any belief about the material world.

The externalist rejects internalism and asserts the following principle:

- externalism: A subject, S, know a proposition, p, when it is in fact the case that the conditions for knowing that p is true are met, whether or not S himself know that these conditions are met.

Externalists disagree about how the conditions for knowledge are specified. Some (e.g., Michael Williams, hold to a version of the Principle of Sensitivity that we discussed last week and accept some form of contextualism. However, others, e.g. Ernest Sosa, reject the Principle of Sensitivity, on the grounds that it leads either to a refection of the Closure Principle or to the claim that we have knowledge that cannot be expressed. Sosa argues for a Reliability Principle:

- Reliability Principle: S’s belief that p amounts to knowledge if the belief-forming mechanisms that lead S to believe p are reliable. A belief-forming mechanism is reliable if, for the most part, S comes to believe p only if p is true.

Sosa calls a belief that is arrived at on the basis of a reliable belief-forming mechanism safe. He replaces the account of reliability that is based on the idea of sensitivity (A’s belief that p is safe iff, A would not believe that p without its being the case that p

If the mechanisms by which A forms beliefs are reliable, then, in general or for the most part, A’s true beliefs are safe (A would not have the belief that p without its being the case that p).

Sosa’s Externalism is not committed to denying the Closure Principle or to holding that we have knowledge that we cannot affirm without ceasing to know it. Suppose that I have a belief that I have hands that meets the externalist requirement on reliability, i.e. that meets the demand that it is formed on the basis of ways of forming beliefs that are such that the beliefs we thereby form are, generally and for the most part, true (so if it weren’t true that I had hands, I wouldn’t on the basis of these ways of forming beliefs believe I had hands). And suppose I know that my having hands entails -BIV. Then, in the basis of the Closure Principle, I know -BIV. The reliability of my belief (the safeness of my belief) is preserved under known logical entailment. So, unlike the contextualist, Sosa holds that we are in a position to know that the sceptical hypotheses are false.

Externalism does, however, reject the Interativity Principle. The externalist sees this principle as definitive of internalism. It is not the case, for the Externalist that Kp>KKp; this follows from the fact that, for the externalist, the conditions for Kp may be met (p, Bp and Bp is safe) without one knowing (or needing to know) that they are met.

Clearly it is not enough for the Externalist to defeat scepticism merely to show that it is possible for an epistemic agent to know something. As Sosa says, what we want is a ‘knowledgeable understanding’ of our ability to know things. In order to defeat the sceptic and achieve this knowledgeable understand, I have to show that I have good reason to believe that it is possible for me to know something. And this me3ans that I must have some reason to believe that the beliefs I have acquired about the world are acquired on the basis of belief-forming mechanisms that are reliable.

What reason do I have to believe that? Our best scientific account of the world provides an account f human perception on which we can recognize that perception is a reliable way to form beliefs about the world. But aren’t we assuming that our belief-forming mechanisms are reliable in forming this account? So the reason we have given argues in a circle.

Sosa accepts that there is an implicit circularity here: our reason for accepting the we are in a position to acquire knowledge about the world on the basis of perception is based on the use of our perceptual capacities. However, he believes that this is not a fatal objection. To suppose that it is to revert to internalism and to the demand that we provide a full, general, legitimating account of human knowledge, i.e. that we justify, without dogmatism and without arguing in a circle, that beliefs based on sense perception are true. This demand cannot be met. But according to Sosa, it does not have to be met in order for us to possess a satisfactory philosophical understanding of how human knowledge is possible.

Suppose that W is our totality of belief-forming mechanisms (including sense perception, memory, testimony). Suppose that W is the basis of all our beliefs about the world and that we use W to assure ourselves that W is reliable. Then, he argues, the very best conceivable outcome of this enquiry is:
- (a)	W is reliable
- (b)	We are correct in our description of W
- (c)	We believe W is reliable and we believe this on the basis of W

What, he asks, could conceivably be missing if we have all of (a)-(c)? The idea that a legitimizing proof is what is missing is an illusion, for it is agreed that no such proof can conceivably be given. It is true, Sosa concedes, that a self-supporting argument for the reliability of one’s belief-forming mechanisms are reliable must be true and must be based on belief-forming mechanisms that are in fact reliable. As ling as these conditions are met, the circle is not vicious. It only appears vicious, Sosa argues, if we assume an Internalist conception of the conditions for knowledge.
