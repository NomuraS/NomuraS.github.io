# Strawson’s Transcendental Argument: Lecture Records [Scepticism] #8

### Transcendental arguments(超越論的議論)
A transcendental argument is an argument that attempts to show that our ability to do something (e.g. to be conscious of ourselves, or to represent the world in a certain way) presupposes certain things, is that, given the former, we can have a priori knowledge of the latter.

A transcendental argument begins with the question ‘how is X possible?’ or ‘what are the necessary conditions for the possibility of X?’. If X is something that the sceptic himself cannot deny (say, that he is self-conscious, or that he represents the world as being a certain way) then the aim of a transcendental argument is to establish that X has necessary conditions that are incompatible with the sceptic’s doubts.

### Strawson’s Transcendental Argument
Our conceptual scheme incorporates an ontology of objective particulars, i.e. we think of the world as containing particulars some of which are independent of ourselves’. Note that this is a claim about how we conceive or think about the world, and not a claim about what is the case.

It is a necessary condition of our thinking of the world as comprising objective particulars that we are able to make ‘identifying reference’ to instances of such particulars.

‘That it should be possible to identify particulars of a given type seems a necessary condition of the inclusion of that type in our ontology. For what could me mean by claiming to acknowledge the existence of class of particular things and to talk to each other about members of this class, if we qualified the claim by adding that it was in principle impossible for anyone of us to make any other of us understand which member, or members, of this class he was at any time talking about’. (p16)

Many ordinary cases of identifying reference to particulars involve demonstrative identification: ‘this chair is the one I want you to sit on’, ‘that car was going very fast’. ‘That was a loud bang’. This depends on our being in a position directly to locate the particular referred to.

Not all identifying reference is demonstrative. We identify particular that are either temporarily or permanently out of sensible range. Some of these may be identified by uniquely identifying descriptions (‘the firs dog to be born at sea’). However, standardly we incorporate a demonstrative element in these cases too: Tony Blair is the president of the UK.

At any moment each of us is in possession of ‘a unified framework of knowledge of particulars, in which we ourselves and, usually, our immediate surroundings have their place, and of which each element is uniquely related to every other and hence to ourselves and our surroundings’. And, given that we are each of us in possession of this framework, we are always in a position to employ it in making identifying reference to a particular by connecting it with this framework.

‘The system of spatio-temporal relations has a peculiar comprehensiveness and pervasiveness, which qualify it uniquely to serve as a framework within which we can organise our individuating thought about particulars.’ (p25)

‘By means of identifying references, we fit other people’s reports and stories, along with our own, into a single story about empirical reality; and this fitting together, this connection, rests ultimately on relating the particulars which figure in the stories in the single spatio-temporal system which we ourselves occupy. (p29)

Our concept of reality is such that the criterion of something’s being real, or of an event’s really occurring, is precisely that it should be such that it can be fitted into this unified spatio-temporal system.

It is a necessary condition of our operating the scheme of a single unified spatio-temporal system or framework o particulars that we are able, not merely to identify particulars, but also to re-identify them. That is, ‘we must have criteria or methods of identifying a particular encountered on one occasion… as the same individual as a particular encountered on another occasion’ (p31). This is essential if we are to conceive of ourselves as operating the same scheme on different occasions. There must, therefore, be methods or criteria for the re-identification of elements across different occasions of our applying the scheme. ch criteria must allow for the fact that we do not observe any part of the framework continuously, and that we ourselves do not occupy a fixed point within it. Our criteria of re-identification must work in circumstances of discontinuous and limited observation. This means that they must rely on ‘qualitative recurrences’, i.e. on ‘the fact of repeated observational encounters with the same pattern or arrangement of objects’.

‘There is no doubt that we have the idea of a single spatio-temporal system of material things; the idea of every material thing at any time beings spatially related, in various ways at various times, to every other at every time. There is no doubt at all that this is our conceptual scheme. Now I say that a condition of our having this conceptual scheme is the unquestioning acceptance of particular-identity in at least come cases of non-continuous observation. Let us suppose for a moment that we were never willing to ascribe particular-identity in such cases. Then we should, as it were, have the idea of a new, a different, spatial system for each new continuous stretch of observation… for each new system would be wholly independent of every other. There would be no question of doubt about the identity of an item in any one system with an item in another. For such doubt makes sense only if the two systems are not independent, if they are parts, in some way related, of a single system which includes them both. But the condition of having such a system is precisely the condition that there should be satisfied criteria for the identity of at least some items in one sub-system with some items in the other.

The sceptic wishes to raise a doubt as to whether I’m ever in a position to re-identify a particular as the same one that was referred to on a precious occasion. He argues that the evidence on which re-identification is based falls short of establishing the numerical identity of the objects referred to, and so I cannot be said to know more than that a certain pattern of experience is repeated (mere qualitative identity). In this way, he puts the existence of a realm of external, spatio-temporally continuous objects, in doubt.

Strawson argues that it is a condition of our making the distinction between numerical and qualitative identity that we possess a conceptual scheme that includes the concept through time, we could not raise the question whether the object I’m currently perceiving is numerically identical, or merely qualitatively identical, with one I saw earlier. But it is a condition of possessing this concept is that we have criteria (usable in our circumstances) for re-identifying particulars as ‘the same again’, not merely qualitatively, but numerically. It is therefore a condition on our possessing this concept that we acknowledge that we posses criteria by which objects are re-possessing the concept that is essential to the expression of his doubt that the doubts are rejected. Strawson sums up the point as follows:

‘[the sceptic] pretends to accept a conceptual scheme, but at the same time quietly rejects one of the conditions of its employment. Thus his doubts are unreal, not simply because they are logically irresoluble doubts, but because they amount to a rejection of the whole conceptual scheme within which alone such doubts make sense’.
