# Semantic Externalism (Putnam's "Brains in a Vat") #7

## Putnam’s argument

### Sceptical hypotheses
I am and always have been a brain in a vat (BIV) of nutrients that is fed sensory data via its attachment to a computer operated according to a programme that gives these experiences their characteristic regularity.

It is a necessary condition of my being able to think the thought “I am a BIV” that this thought is false. Therefore, it is false.

### Semantic externalism
In order for a term , t, to refer to objections of a kind , K, the speaker or thinker of the language to which t belongs must enter into causal relations with objects of the kind K.

### The argument as presented by Putnam
When a BIV says “there is a tree in front of me”, his thought dose not refer to trees, but trees-in-the-image. The same argument that shows that a BIV is not referring to trees can be applied to the words “brain” and “vat” in the BIV’s language. If the possible world of BIVs is the actual world and we really are BIVs, then what we now mean by the words “I am a BIV” is that I am a BIV-in-the-image. So, if I am a BIV in the way the sceptical hypothesis describes, “I am a BIV” says something false (if it says anything). So if I am a BIV, than “I am a BIV” is false. So it is necessarily false.

### Systematization of Putnam’s Argument
1. 　either I am a BIV or I am a non-BIV
2.　if I am a BIV, the my utterance of “I am a BIV” is true-in-vat-English iff I am a BIV-in-the-image.
3.　If I am a BIV, I do not have the sensory impression that I am a BIV.
4.　If I am a BIV, then my utterance of “I am a BIV” is false-in-vat-English.
5.　If I am a non-BIV, the my utterance of “I am a BIV” is true-in-English iff I am a BIV
6.　If I am a non-BIV, then my utterance of “I am a BIV” is false-in-English.
7.　Any utterance (in either vat-English or English) of “I am a BIV” is false.
8.　Any utterance (in either vat-English or English) of “I am a non-BIV” is true.

### Argument schema of a constructive Dilemma
- P∨Q
- P⊃R
- Q⊃R
- R

### Objection to Putnam’s argument
There is no univocal proposition that asserts I am a non-BIV that we can substitute for R. the only proposition that we can substitute for R is a meta-linguistic one: the thought expressed by the words “I am a non- BIV” is conclusion that any utterance of the sentence “I am a non-BIV” is true. This falls short of the anti-sceptical conclusion that I am not a BIV.

### Reply
An agent who constructs Putnam’s constructive argument arrives at the conclusion that an utterance of “I am a non-BIV” is true. He has now only to use his understanding of the sentence “I am a non-BIV” and his understanding of the word “true” to move from the meta-linguistic conclusion, “I am a non-BIV” is true, to the outright assertion: I am a non-BIV. Even if I do not know whether I am using English or vat-English, I know that “I am a non-BIV” is true-in-my-language iff I am a non-
BIV. So, if I know “I am a non-BIV” is true-in-my-language, I know I am a non-BIV.

### Objection
The agent does not know whether the content of the thought he expresses when he affirms that he is a non-BIV is such that it is compatible with his really being a BIV or not. I can only know that my conclusion that I am a non- BIV is denial of scepticism if I know that my words “brain” and “vat” refer to brains an cats, and not to brains-in-the-image and vats-in-the-image. The semantic externalism that enables me to achieve the meta-linguistic conclusion. Even if it is combined with thoughts about disputation to get me to an outright affirmation that I am a non-BIV, also prevents this amounting to a conclusion that is genuinely anti-sceptical. Whether ist is anti0sveptical will depend on whether or not the words of my language mean real brains and real vats, or only brains-in-the=image and vats-in-the-image, and this is something I am not in a position to determine.

We might make the same point as follows: A BIV could construct Putnam’s argument and come to the conclusion; I am a non-BIV. However, for all that we do not tale his conclusion to amount to a proof that he is not a BIV, for ex hypothesis, he is a BIV. Given that the content of the thought we express with the words “I am a non-BIV” depends on whether or not the speaker is a BIV or a non-BIV, how do I know that the content of the thought I express with these words is not compatible with my actually. In reality, being a BIV? How do I know that the thought that I express with these words is not the thought that I am not a BIV-in-the-image?

### Reply
The above objection tries to draw a contrast between contents that would require it to be possible to use the term “BIV” in a way that is free from the causal constraints that the semantic externalist claims to operate on reference. I want to formulate the thought that the content of the thought I express with the words “I am a non-BIV” is compatible with my being actually, or in reality, a BIV. But what is the content of this latter thought? Putnam’s argument is that insofar as the thought “I am a non-BIV” is thinkable. I am in a position to affirm that it is true. And given that I am in a position to affirm that it is true, I’m in a position to affirm I’m a non-BIV. There simply is no other thought that I can now use to circumscribe, in a sceptical fashion, the conclusion I have reached, there is no thought that I can express that allows me to say that , for all that , I might be a BIV anyway ,. If I say, but a BIV could run through the same argument, that is strictly incorrect. The BIV could word through the same argument. That is strictly incorrect. The BIV could word through an argument using the same words, but only a creature which is a non-BIV could reach the conclusion I’ve reached, could have the thought that it is a non-BIV.
