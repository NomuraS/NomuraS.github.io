## Freud’s theory of personal development (psychosexual stages)

Freud believed that there are distinct stages in child development. At each stage one particular drive (libido) is seeking gratification. 

### 1) the oral stage (birth - 1 year old)
most sensitive area (erogenous zone) is the mouth. Infants gain pleasure from sucking, swallowing, biting and from putting things in its mouth. “Adequate stimulation” is required.
- too little (Frustration) -> greedy, envious, pessimistic, cynical, sarcastic, often loners, suffering depression.
- too much (over indulgence) -> trusting, easily conned bu others, optimistic, dependent, high opinion of themselves, short tempers. 

### 2) the anal stage (1-3 years old)
libido moves to anal area from the mouth. Infants gain pleasures from emptying, controlling their bowels. Ego is forming at this stage as infant must learn that must control the urge to empty bowels (potty training). Also infants may be aware that they have control and may manipulate this to their advantage.
The way in which the adult handles potty training may influence whether or not the child becomes fixated. This will be influenced by amount of discipline used. 
- Anal retentive-> orderly, clean, miserly, obstinate, cruel
- expulsive -> untidy, generous, impulsive

### 3) the phallic stage (3-6 years old)
Freud believed that this was the most important stage for personality development. Pleasure seeking is genitals. Child begins to have unconscious longings for the opposite sex.
- Boys long for mothers; however, because they know that the father is their rival it leads to Oedipus conflict (complex). All this is occurring at an unconscious level.
- Girls　long for fathers －〃－ Electra conflict (complex). 

How the child copes with those anxieties and feeling is that Freud says that coping with these feeling with identifying with same sax parent. (i.e. he tries to be like his father.) this identification leads the child to adopt that parent’s values, ideas, behaviour, etc. this is how the infant develops and acquired fender and morals. Because of moral development, this is the stage when the super-ego develops. Meanwhile, with relation to girls, Freud suggested that the conflict was less intense because the girl feels she gas already been castrated and gad less fear of mother because of this. Because fear identification was less strong, her gender identity and moral development would be weaker. 
- a fixation in this stage could be lead to personality traits such as vanity, reckless, self-centred, ambitions, exploitation of others.

### 4) latency stage (5-12 years old)
- during this stage, the libido has spread throughout the body. The focus has shifted and intellectual development. 
- the infants still identifies with the same sax parent.
- the relationship between the id, ego and super-ego is well balanced.
- idea that children are using libido (energy) to learn about world, gain required skills.
- no fixation us usually exhibited linked to this stage.

### 5) genital stage (12- years old)
- due to puberty and development, the libido seeks satisfaction from the opposite sex.
- an adolescent who has successfully progressed through the previous stages will be able to form mature relationship and satisfy the id realistically. If there is a fixation or unsolved conflict from a previous stage, then the person may have problems with sexual relationships.
- as this is final stage, fixation here is the norm.
